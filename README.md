# Hey there 👋 I'm Hossein

I'm a developer who enjoys turning ideas into code. I like working on new projects, learning as I go, and constantly challenging myself.

I believe the best way to grow is to build — and break things occasionally along the way 😄

When I'm not coding, you can probably find me hanging out with a cat 🐱 or thinking about my next side project.

## 🧠 Currently Learning & Building

I'm working on **Netpick.ir** — a web app to let people make better web apps (meta, right?).  
It’s a playground for learning, and it’s also where I’m experimenting with cool stuff like:

- 📱 Mobile design — because dev tools should actually work on your phone
- 🧱 Web app building tools — from idea to deployment in a smoother way  
- 🕹️ WebAssembly — yes, I *do* want to run **Doom** in the browser (fingers crossed 🤞)    
- 🧠 AI-assisted features — think code hints, smarter UI suggestions, or generative content  
- 🐛 Breaking things just to see if I can fix them (a crucial step in the dev process)

If it sounds chaotic, that's because it is — and I love it.
